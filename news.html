                        far to set up a title decider against France on the final weekend.

                        Like England, Ireland have won two of their three games and France are the only team still
                        chasing a Grand Slam.

                        "Ireland have been playing some really good rugby," Marler said.

                        Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the 31-year-old continued: "Today's session was tastier than the
                        previous because we know how good we have to be at the weekend.

                        "We have to step up our game."

                        How the Six Nations is reaching the next generation
                        Listen to Rugby Union Daily as the rugby pods unite
                        'I've never felt like an underdog at Twickenham'
                        England held on to beat Wales 23-19 in their last outing at Twickenham, but struggled to find
                        fluidity in their attack.

                        Ireland claimed a dominant 29-7 victory against Wales in their opener before putting up a good
                        fight against France in a 30-24 loss.

                        Given Ireland's impressive form, both head coach Jones and hooker Jamie George say the visitors
                        are favourites to win, but Marler disagrees.

                        "I don't think I've ever felt like an underdog at Twickenham," the Harlequins prop said.

                        "Instead, I look at it and think 'I know how good Ireland are. I know how good their tight-heads
                        are. I know how good their pack is. I know how good their attacking system is'.

                        "We all look at that and we know how good they are, so we have to be right on the money."

                        'Melted wheelie bin' Furlong
                        The job of England's front row will be made particularly difficult by talented Ireland prop
                        Tadhg Furlong.

                        Furlong is as fleet of foot as he is forceful up front and Marler is well aware of the challenge
                        ahead.

                        "He has got the ability to anchor a scrum with his massive chest, his massive weight and do that
                        over and over to give his side a platform to play off really quick ball," Marler said.

                        "He's got the ability to do that but then get up and stand in an attacking position.

                        "He's playing off 10 [taking passes from the Ireland fly-half], yet he looks like he shouldn't
                        be able to do that. He looks like a very traditional front-rower - a melted wheelie bin a bit
                        like me."</p>
